# MIND therapy

According to the CBC, in a new survey conducted jointly by the Angus Reid Institute, 54 per cent of Canadians said their mental health had worsened during the past two years â€” with women faring significantly worse than men (2022). 

Despite a growing number of Canadians affected by mental health, barriers and stigmas concerning mental health issues continue to exist, often discouraging sufferers from seeking the professional help and beneficial treatments that they need.

MIND is an online platform connecting Canadians to medical professionals, counsellors and licensed therapists to help Canadians find the treatments they need.
